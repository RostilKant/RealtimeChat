ASP.NET Core Identity was used for user authentication. It is using PBKDF2 - Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2.  

Advantages of using PBKDF2:                                                                                                                                       
- Strong hash algoritm - HMAC-SHA256
- Random 128-bit salt for each hash, generated by secure RNG
- Adding iterations(default 10 000), which make algoritm "future-proof"
